# Predicting-success-for-ICO-funding

Crowdfunding involves several individuals contributing to raise funds for a certain company or project 
and is frequently handled online through a listed website or governing body. The company may 
advertise their initiative through various means to reach their fundraising goal. The Initial Coin 
Offering, or ICO, is a unique type of online crowdfunding investment (Agrawal, Catalini, & Goldfarb, 
2015) in which a company seeking funds offers a new digital coin or token to potential investors in 
return for Ethereum or Bitcoin, essentially based on distributed ledger technology (Fisch, 2019). 
These issued coins can subsequently be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges or inside the 
ecosystem of the proposed enterprise.  
This sort of emerging crowdfunding is highly uncontrolled (Cronqvist, Siegel, & Yu, 2015) and draws 
speculative investors interested in the possible profits from the success of the proposed venture. 
ICOs are typically used by early-stage firms or projects that have yet to build a service, platform, or 
product (Huang, Vismara, & Wei). The goal is to successfully raise funds for the proposed business, 
service, or platform for which the ICO is being launched. 
The primary aim of this study is to apply machine learning models to predict whether a project or 
company will successfully raise funds using an ICO. To examine the success factor and the elements 
that contribute to it, over 2000 projects from diverse firms and teams will be employed. 
A dataset encompassing different ICO initiatives, and their outcomes was provided to target this 
investigation. Since the target variable is binary “Yes” or “No” it is understood that this is a 
classification problem. On this data, four classification models will be trained and tested, and the top 
performing model on unseen data will be identified.
